# ## Assignment: Organising a Colour Palette 
# This notetbook offers some auxiliary code to support your programming assignment.    

# ### Reading the data file 

# In[1]:


import numpy as np      # Numerical library, used keeing the list of colours and computing the Euclidean distance
import pandas as pd

# Read in the color data file 
# Input: string with file name
# Oputput: the number of colours (integer), and a list numpy arrays with all the colours
def read_data(fname):
    cols = np.loadtxt(fname, skiprows = 4) # The first 4 lines have text information, and are ignored     
    ncols = len(cols)     # Total number of colours and list of colours
    return ncols,cols


# #### Read and explore the data file: either the 10, 100, or 500 colours dataset
# 
# The colorus are stored in a list, where each element of the list is a numpy array of dimension 3. That is arrays of 3 real numbers where the real numbers indicate the R,G, and B values of the colour (RGB colour model). 

# In[2]:


ncolors, colors = read_data("col100.txt")

print(f'Number of colours: {ncolors}')
print("First 5 colours:")
print(colors[0:5,  :])


# ### Plotting a sequence of colours
# 
# The function <b>plot_colors()</b> displaysthe colours from the color list *col_list* the order given by the *col_order* list. 
# 
# *col_list* and *col_order* need to be of the same length. The *ratio* parameter indicates height/width proportion of each bar of colour in the plot.

# In[3]:


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Dsiplay the colors as a strip of color bars
# Input: list of colors, order of colors, and height/ratio

def plot_colors(col_list, col_order, ratio = 10): 
    assert len(col_list) == len(col_order)
    img = np.zeros((ratio, len(col_list), 3))
    for i in range(0, len(col_list)):
        img[:, i, :] = col_list[col_order[i]]
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, figsize=(10,6)) # figsize=(width,height) handles window dimensions
    axes.imshow(img, interpolation='nearest')
    axes.axis('off')
    plt.show()


# ### Examples of ploting a colour ordering
# 
# Let us see how to call the plot function, using the original order in which the colours appear in the data file, and another randomised order.

# In[4]:


import random as rnd

# Plot all the colors in the order they are listd in the file
order1 = list(range(ncolors))   # list of consequtive numbers from 0 to ncolors
plot_colors(colors, order1)    #  You will notice that colors are not ordered in the file

# Function to generate a random solution (random ordering)  - we can generate a random ordering of the list by using
# the shuffle function from the random library
def random_sol():
    sol = list(range(ncolors))   # list of consequtive numbers from 0 to ncolors
    # Shuffle the elements in the list randomly. Shuffles in place and doesnâ€™t retunr a value
    rnd.shuffle(sol)   
    return sol

order2 = random_sol()
print("Another random solution: ", order2)
plot_colors(colors, order2)  # the colors are not ordered, but this is a different order

# You can test different ratios of the hight/width of the lines in the plot
print("Same ordering of colurs with a larger ratio")
plot_colors(colors, order2, 20)


# ### Evaluation function to determine the quality of a given ordering of colours
# 
# When solving the problem using optimisation heuristics, we need an evaluation function to measure the quality of a sulution. The problem is formulated as a minimisation  problem. We want to minimise the pair-wise distance between consequtive colours in the ordering. 
# 
# This function computes the quality of given ordering of colours. The smaller the evaluation function the better, as this is is formulated as a minimisation problem

# In[5]:


# This is an auxiliary function. It calculate the Euclidean distance between two individual colours
# Input: v and u as to be numpy arrays, vectors of real numbers with the RGB coordinates.

def euclid(v, u):
    return np.linalg.norm(v - u)

# Evaluation function.  Measures the quality of a given solution (ordering of colours) 
# The function computes the sum of the distances between all consecutive colours in the ordering
# Input: cols: list of colours 
#        ordc: ordering of colours
# Output: real number with the sumf of pair-wise differences in the colour ordering

def evaluate(cols, ordc):     
    adjacentColPairs = [[cols[ordc[i]],cols[ordc[i-1]]] for i in range(1,len(ordc))]
    return sum([euclid(i[1], i[0]) for i in adjacentColPairs])


# #### Evaluating the quality of given solutions
# 
# Let us use the evaluation function to calculate the quality of the arbitrary orderings of colours *order1* and *order2*

# In[6]:


e1 = evaluate(colors, order1)
print(f'Evaluation of order1: {e1}') # Displaying all decimals
print(f'Evaluation of order1: {np.round(e1,4)}') # rounding to display only 4 decimals. This is better for display

e2 = evaluate(colors, order2)
print(f'Evaluation of order1: {e2}') # Displaying all decimals
print(f'Evaluation of order1: {np.round(e2,4)}') # rounding to display only 4 decimals. This is better for display


# # Random Neighbour
The random neighbour function uses a 2-bit flip mutation on the solution it receives by swapping two randomly generated index values. The resulting solution (known as the random neighbour) is then returned for evaluation. The function also keeps track of all visited solutions so that it only returns solutions which haven't been explored. The 2 bit flip was chosen because its a simple but effective algorithm which can help the multi hill reach the local maximum faster. 
# In[7]:


def random_neighbour(solution):
    rand_index = rnd.randint(0, len(solution) - 1)
    rand_index_2 = rnd.randint(0, len(solution) - 1)

    while rand_index == rand_index_2: # Ensures that the two random indexes are not the same
        rand_index_2 = rnd.randint(0, len(solution) - 1)

    solution[rand_index], solution[rand_index_2] = solution[rand_index_2], solution[rand_index] # Swaps the two index values

    return solution

# ### Multi-Hill Best 100
The main experimentation was done on this section by running the multi hill algorithm numberous times and monitoring the values found in each run. Instead of randomly guessing which iterations to use, a "for loop" was used to run the multi hill algorithm numbers times, manipulating he iterations with each run. The idea was to see which number of iterations produced the best results. 

In the particular run below for example the algorithm runs 10 times. In each run the multi hill tries are incremented by 50 and the hill tries are incremented by 100. The results are then displayed in table form for evaluation. Other tests conducted included only incrementing the hill climbing iterations, only incrementing multi hill tries, using the same amount of iterations with each run etc. The best solution found was:

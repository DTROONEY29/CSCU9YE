---------------------------------------------------------
Fields-----------------
-----------------------
Natural language processing and voice recognition 
Computer vision and image processing (MY THING!)
Autonomous robotics 
Self driving cars 
Game playing 
Decision making 

---------- Natural Language ------------

Speech tech - alexa, siri, google assistant 

language processsing tech - machine translation 
                            web search 
                            text classification
                            sentiment analysis 
                            spam  filtering 
                            recommendation systems 

------------ PERCEPTION ----------
Face recognition 
Object recognition 
Image classification 
object tracking and behaviour recognition 

**** THIS IS ALL MY STUFF ***

------------ ROBOTICS --------------

Robotics 
--------
- part mech eng. based
- part AI 
- Reality is harder than simulations !

Applications
--------------

- Vehicles 
- Rescue 
- Domestic help
- Space exploration 
- Football!

---------- Boston dynamics ---------

Combine principles of :
Dynamic control
sophisticated mechanical designs 
Cutting edge electronics 
Next gen software 

- High performance robots equipped with:
  PERCEPTION
  Navigation 
  Intelligence

  ----------- Game playing -----------

  DEEP BLUE BY IBM - Read up or watch a video or something...

  AlphaGO by Deep Mind (Google)m- watch a video


In video games AI Techniques are applied:
- Pathfinding with search algorithms 
- Decision Trees 
- Evolutionary algorithms 

NPCs with changing behaviour to make the game more interesting!!

------------- Decision Making --------------


SCHEDULING - Process of arranging work and activities to achieve goals and priorities!
- Airline flights 
- Jobs in industry
- Personnel (rotas etc)

CUTTING AND PACKING:
- Packaging and distribtion 
- Clothing/metal industry (where to cut material to minimise waste etc.)

ROUTE PLANNING:
- Google maps 
- Space exploration 

DESIGN OF TIMETABLES:
- When to timetable things and how to format a timetable.

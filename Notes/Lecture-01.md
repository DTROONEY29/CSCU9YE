-------------------------------------------------------------

What is intelligence? 

Properties of intelligence :

- Percieve, understand and predict 
- Learn, solve problems and devise plans 
- Play games and answer questions 

Definitions of AI organised into 4 categories:

- Thinking Humanly - the cognitive modelling approach
- Thinking rationally - "The laws of thought approach"
- Acting Humanly - The Turing test approach
- Acting rationally - The rational agent approach 


------------------------------------------------------------
The Turing test 

Turing test was a test conducted where an interrogator would 
have a blind text conversation with multiple people, where
one of these people was actually a machine. The measure of
intelligence was how undistinquishable the machine was to it's 
human counterparts.

This doesn't really work as a goal for intelligence.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Acting rationally : rational agent

Rational behaviour = doing the right thing 

The RIGHT THING: that which is expected to maximise goal
achievement, given the available information.

Doesnt necessarily involve thinking e.g. blinking reflex

Thinking should be in the service of rational action.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Intelligent Agents - see slides for diagram 

Each agent implements a function that maps percept 
sequences to actions.

There are different ways to represent these functions

NOTE TO SELF: CHECK OUT Control theory and cybernetics..... for fun!

Short History of AI
-------------------
1943 Boolean circuit model of brain
1950 Turing test

1950s to 1970s 
Early AI programs 
Dartmouth meeting
Robinsons algorithm 

1970s to 1990s
Early development of knowledge based systems 
Expert systems industry booms 
Expert systems industry bursts "AI WINTER"

1990 - now
Focus on probability, focus on uncertainty
Increase in technical depth
Agents and learning systems 
AI SPRING 
What next???
